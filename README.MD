#NShop

Welcome to NShop, a brand-new OpenSource solution in e-commerce entirely based on JS (That's it JavaScript!).

So, It is still early development fase. We just started our project and we still have long path to finish. But soon we will accomplish it.


##What should I know first?

###Tech Stack

Our tech stack is lovely <3

1. Meteor

Meteor is a full-stack framework all written in JavaScript. It runs on server using Node.js and it has MongoDB as a database;

2. React

React is becoming the most popular UI framework ever. Well, it is easy to understand, they have server rendering and a easy-to-learn
`.jsx` files, which mix JS with html, making really easy to write components. Also, it accepts ES6 sintax which is great!


## Getting Started

First of all you'll need Node.js. Depending on your OS it'll be different.

Ubuntu and Debian:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

If you have another distro or OS, you can check [Node.js's](https://nodejs.org) Website.

You'll also need to install MongoDB

`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install mongodb-org`

You can also check the [MongoDB's](https://mongodb.org) website for more details.

Ok, after having everything set, we can install [Meteor](http://meteorjs.com)!

For OSX and Linux:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

That's it!

Now, you can clone the repo and have the project on your computer.

`git clone https://github.com/andredeloliveira/NShop.git`

If you want to know better about React, Meteor and Mongo, please, have a look into
their docs. They are really good!

[Meteor](https://meteor.com)
[MongoDB](https://mongodb.org)

Happy coding!

Cheers,
