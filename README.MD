#NShop

Welcome to NShop, a brand-new OpenSource solution in e-commerce entirely based on JS (That's it, JavaScript!).

So, It is still on the early steps of development. We just started our project and we still have a long path to finish. But soon, we will accomplish it.


##What should I know first?

###Tech Stack


1. Meteor

Meteor is a full-stack framework all written in JavaScript. It runs on server using Node.js and it has MongoDB as a database;

2. React

React is easy to understand and it's fast! It has server rendering and a easy-to-learn
`.jsx` files, which mix JS and html. Also, it accepts ES6 sintax.

3. Semantic-ui  

We use Semantic-ui to organize the UI. More info and docs [here](http://Semantic-ui.com);

## Getting Started

Node.js:

Ubuntu and Debian:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -`

`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

If you have another distro or OS, you can check [Node.js's](https://nodejs.org) Website.

You'll also need to install MongoDB

`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install mongodb-org`

You can also check the [MongoDB's](https://mongodb.org) website for more details.

Ok, after having everything set, we can install [Meteor](http://meteorjs.com)!

For OSX and Linux:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

That's it!

Now, you can clone the repo and have the project on your computer.

`git clone https://github.com/andredeloliveira/NShop.git`


## Populating the Database

First, you need to install the package node-mongo-seeds:

`npm install -g node-mongo-seeds`

Then, you can run the command `seed` inside the folder `db/` to populate the data base.

All done. Go play!


If you want to know better about React, Meteor and Mongo, please, have a look into
their docs. They are really good!

Happy coding!
